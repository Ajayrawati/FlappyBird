#FlappyBird

FlappyBird is a simple yet engaging game developed using the Unity Game Engine and the C# programming language. This project was created as a part of my journey to learn game development and familiarize myself with Unity's interface and features.

Game Overview
In FlappyBird, the player controls a bird by tapping the screen or pressing a key to make the bird "flap" and fly between obstacles. The objective is to fly as far as possible without hitting any obstacles.

Features
    2D physics-based gameplay
    Procedurally generated obstacles
    Score tracking system
    Simple, clean interface
How to Play
    Tap the screen (or press the designated key) to make the bird flap its wings and gain height.
    Avoid hitting the obstacles (pipes) by carefully timing your flaps.
    The game ends if the bird touches the ground or an obstacle.
    The farther you go, the higher your score!
Controls
    PC: Press the spacebar or click the mouse to make the bird flap.
    Mobile: Tap the screen to make the bird flap.

My Journey
This is the first game I've developed while learning Unity. It helped me gain hands-on experience with Unity's interface, game mechanics, and scripting with C#. The project also involved implementing simple physics, collision detection, and basic gameplay features.

Future Improvements
    Add different difficulty levels.
    Include sound effects and background music.
    Enhance the visual design and animations.
    Add more game modes or power-ups.
